   First we need to create the AWS MySQL database (DB) instance and remotely connect the database with Flask. The process to create the DB instance has been explained in this Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@shawkh9007/connecting-aws-rds-mysql-database-with-flask-app-3cac9e754a74">article</a>.

   Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file by executing  pip install -r requirements.txt. I would suggest creating an environment first before installing the libraries. Then change your directory to the folder where you downloaded the project in the command prompt (CMD) and  run the command flask run. After successful run, you can see a webpage shown below. The graphs were obtained from this <a href="https://www.chartjs.org">site</a>.
